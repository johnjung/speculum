<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In 1540 Antonio Lafreri, a native of Besan√ßon transplanted to Rome, began
publishing maps and other printed images that depicted major monuments and
antiquities in Rome. These images were calculated to appeal to the taste for
classical antiquity that fueled the cultural event we call the Renaissance.
After Lafreri published a title page in the mid-1570s, collections of these
prints came to be known as the <i>Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae</i>, the
&quot;Mirror of Roman Magnificence.&quot; Tourists and other collectors who
bought prints from Lafreri made their own selections and had them individually
bound. Over time, Lafreri's title page served as starting point for large
and eclectic compilations, expanded and rearranged by generations of
collectors.</p> 

<br style="height: 1em;"/>

<p>The University of Chicago's Special Collections Research Center holds the
largest <i>Speculum</i> collection. This group of 994 prints (engravings,
etchings, and a few woodcuts) was brought together by a nineteenth-century
collector; it is organized around a core of prints published by Lafreri but
also includes many other related prints. This site provides scholars, students,
and art lovers with access to this collection at a distance -- much as prints
themselves originally afforded a view of Rome from afar.</p>

<br style="height: 1em;"/>

<p>The <i>Speculum</i> and related prints are presented here as zoomable,
high-resolution digital images with searchable catalogue information. Virtual
itineraries provide paths through selected prints from the collection based on
a particular theme, location, or artist's work.</p>

<p>On November 2-3, 2007, The Virtual Tourist in Renaissance Rome
symposium was held at the University of Chicago. (<a

<p>Catalogue information is still in the process of being updated, and we
welcome contributions and corrections from scholars: please write to <a
