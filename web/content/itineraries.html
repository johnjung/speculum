	<h1>Itineraries</h1>

<p>Virtual itineraries are mini-exhibitions designed by scholars that allow you
to travel through the collection along a particular path based on a theme,
location, collection, or artist. These allow for a more specialized, but
still lively and accessible, introduction to selected works from the
collection, draw attention to particular intellectual questions associated
with these prints, and serve as a new mode of scholarly publishing. We
welcome submissions of itineraries: please first send a query to
<a href="mailto:speculum@uchicago.edu">speculum@uchicago.edu</a>.</p>

	<h2><a href="../itinerary/bensoussan.html">1. The Belvedere Cortile: An Early Museum of Ancient Sculpture</a></h2>
	<a href="../itinerary/index.html?itinerary=bensoussan"><img src="../images/itineraries-0096.jpg" class="itineraryimage"/></a>
	<p class="itineraryauthor">Nicole Bensoussan, Theodore Rousseau Fellow, Harvard University Art Museums</p>
	<p class="itinerarydescription">Beginning in 1506, Bramante designed the Belvedere Cortile, an outdoor garden space to house Pope Julius II's celebrated collection of ancient sculpture. Renaissance prints allowed far-flung artists to study these statues as rare artifacts and models for the representation of human form.</p>

	<a href="../itinerary/index.html?itinerary=boorsch"><img src="../images/itineraries-0015.jpg" class="itineraryimage"/></a>
	<p class="itineraryauthor">Suzanne Boorsch, Robert L. Solley Curator of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs, Yale University Art Gallery</p>
	<p class="itinerarydescription">Arriving in Rome around 1540, Nicolas Beatrizet was hired by both
Antonio Salamanca and his chief rival Antonio Lafreri to make plates of Roman
monuments. These two publishers finally, in 1553, had the good sense to join
forces. Beatrizet also worked with two other publishers before 1558, the year
he began to publish his own plates.  This itinerary&#8213;chronological rather than
geographical&#8213;will follow Beatrizet's work through a dozen productive years.</p>

	<a href="../itinerary/index.html?itinerary=heuer"><img src="../images/itineraries-0212.jpg" class="itineraryimage"/></a>
	<p class="itineraryauthor">Christopher P. Heuer, Assistant Professor, History of Art and Archaeology,
	Princeton University</p>
	<p class="itinerarydescription">Rome's crumbling monuments fascinated Renaissance artists.
	For printmakers, the shattered forms of the Colosseum, the
	labyrinthine Baths of Diocletian, and fragmentary reliefs strewn
	around the Capitoline supplied palpable way to think about the present
	as much as the past.</p>

	<a href="../itinerary/index.html?itinerary=lincoln"><img src="../images/itineraries-0110.jpg" class="itineraryimage"/></a>
	<p class="itineraryauthor">Evelyn Lincoln, Associate Professor, History of Art and Architecture and Italian Studies, Brown University</p>
	<p class="itinerarydescription">Much of Rome was built to accommodate
	the performance of ritual. Interest in the ordinary and extraordinary
	celebrations of events ranging from daily masses to the magnificent triumphal
	entries for visiting potentates extended to a fascination with ancient ritual
	as pictured on the stone friezes and ruins seen everywhere in Christian
	Rome.</p>

	<p class="itineraryauthor">Rebecca Zorach, Associate Professor, Art History, University of Chicago</p>
	<p class="itinerarydescription">The changing face of the Campidoglio in
	Rome, also known as the ancient Capitoline Hill, reinvented in the Renaissance
	and home to a collection of important ancient statues.</p>

	<a href="../itinerary/index.html?itinerary=pollak"><img src="../images/itineraries-0026.jpg" class="itineraryimage"/></a>
	<p class="itineraryauthor">Martha Pollak, Professor of Art History, University of Illinois at Chicago</p>
	<p class="itinerarydescription">One of the largest buildings in Rome,
	Castel Sant'Angelo is a distinguished alalgam of ancient Roman, midieval, and
	early modern elements. This imposing structure features significantly in the
	plans of Rome&#8213;reconstructions of the ancient city, as well as sixteenth
	and eighteenth century plans&#8213;that are part of this collection.</p>

	<a href="../itinerary/index.html?itinerary=turner"><img
src="../images/itineraries-0630.jpg" class="itineraryimage"/></a>
	<p class="itineraryauthor">James Grantham Turner, Professor,
Department of English, University of California, Berkeley</p> 
	<p class="itinerarydescription">To the Renaissance eye, Roman
antiquity seemed to celebrate erotic freedom.  Sculptured reliefs and
cameos depicting the love-affairs of the gods, or the worship of Priapus
and Bacchus, were recorded and imitated by printmakers, while Rosso
Fiorentino and others created the engraving-series <i>The Loves of the
Gods</i>, appreciated for its frank sexuality, visual wit, and
antiquarian allusion.</p>

	<h2><a href="../itinerary/maier.html">8. The Eternal
City: Maps of Rome in the Speculum</a></h2>
	<a href="../itinerary/index.html?itinerary=maier"><img
src="../images/itineraries-0002.jpg" class="itineraryimage"/></a>
	<p class="itineraryauthor">Jessica Maier, Assistant
Professor, Art Department, Mount Holyoke College</p>

<p class="itinerarydescription">The Chicago Speculum opens with a
sequence of printed maps intended to provide the overarching context of
the Eternal City. Rome was by no means a straightforward subject, marked
as it was by countless superimposed layers of history and myth. This
itinerary, a temporal as well as spatial tour through the city, will
track various strategies that artists and printmakers employed to
balance the existing urban reality with the city of the memory and the
imagination.</p>
