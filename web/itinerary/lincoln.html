<div></div><div><h2>Ancient Ritual Sacrifice</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0110"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0110-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>This engraving shows the <em>suovetaurilia</em> at Rome, the combined
sacrifice of a whole pig, a sheep and an ox, the principal animals of
the farmer, and sacred to Mars.  Like most rituals, it marked a
border―in this case, the ending of the census that took place every five
years with a solemn rite of purification (<em>lustrum</em>) made
efficacious by animal sacrifice. The census involved a review of the
classes and centuries on the Campus Martius, overseen by two elected
patrician Censors who listed and classified the members of Roman society
(knights and centuries are mentioned in the caption) so that any alien
elements could be expelled.  Here, a <em>victimarius</em> holding an axe
(<em>popa</em>) is seen near the rear of the procession, while the censors
and tabulated citizens of Rome accompany the group to where the priest
stands in front of the altar.  The engraver mentions that his design
records a marble frieze found in a wall of a building on the Campus
Martius; it is today in the collection of the Louvre.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Sacrifice To The God Silvanus</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0297"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0297-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>One of the oldest of the Roman deities, Silvanus was primarily a god
of agriculture, woods, and boundaries―a forest spirit who had to be
propitiated if woods were cleared or if his territory was otherwise
compromised.  Augustine, in <em>Civitas Dei</em>, promulgated for the
Middle Ages a legend first mentioned by Varro that Silvanus was also a
cruel god, who caused fever in women made vulnerable by childbirth.  For
this reason, groups of three men representing agricultural gods and
goddesses patrolled the homes in which there were pregnant women, or
women who had recently given birth, to keep Silvanus from evil deeds.
The men in the foreground of this image may represent the three men
whose charge it was to defend the houses of new mothers.   Silvanus was
also venerated at male bathhouses as a patron of male health, and later
became charged specifically with the health of emperors.  Offerings to
Silvanus were made to his cult statue, as we see in the engraving,
although later a few temples and chapels were set up in Rome in his
honor.  One inscription to him was found at Claudian baths that later
became the Baths of Constantine.  Because of the relationship between
Constantine and the Bishop Sylvester (Bishop of Rome 314-355) who
baptized him and also founded the Basilica of St. Peter, and also
perhaps because of the similarity in the sound of their names, it seems
that Silvanus became associated with the bishop saint Sylvester.  Many
of the inscriptions found in Rome recording offerings to Silvanus were
found near the site of churches dedicated to Saint Sylvester. Images of
Silvanus on ancient stone altars show him holding lilies or fruit and a
pine bough, for he was also responsible for the bounty of the harvest as
well as the health of farm animals. He was also connected with the gods
Mars and Hercules.  In this Renaissance image the statue of the god is
Martial in aspect, while the lion skin and club that Silvanus holds also
ally him with Hercules.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Frieze Of Sacrificial Instruments</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0128"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0128-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>In the Renaissance, a practical interest in ritual sacrifice extended
from curiosity about the instruments and techniques of ancient worship
to the exact order and history of the elements of the Christian mass,
encompassing information about the odd religious practices of exotic
foreigners such as Jews, Asians, and ancient Egyptians. From about the
13th century Christian scholars seemed to become interested in technical
aspects of pagan blood sacrifice, which Christianity replaced with the
re-enactment of Christ's death and resurrection in the ritual of the
mass.  At the same time,  mendicant friars fanned the flames of popular
suspicion in promulgating the misinformation that Jews living among them
still engaged in blood offerings. Interest in ancient sacrifice arose
along with new and intense veneration of the wounds of Christ, which
worshippers were extolled to visualize in exact measure and detail
through luridly colored woodblock prints that claimed to be life-size,
and which bore captions imploring the viewer to kiss and caress them.
In the 15th-century there arose a cult of the Precious Blood of Christ,
blood which was supposed to have healing value, and which sparked
lasting theological debate between Franciscans and Dominicans over
whether or not the blood that Christ lost on earth was reunited with the
godhead after the Ascension. Theological writing about the medicinal
nature of Christ's blood and the humanistic study of antiquity led to
curiosity about the techniques of ancient rituals of sacrifice involving
blood, of which there was much visual evidence in the form of sculpture
and friezes.  The instruments of Christian mass (the book, bell,
candlesticks, chalice, patten altarcloth, and the wheat of the
Eucharistic host and the grapes for the wine) seemed to be more
civilized echoes of earlier ceremonies, such as the pouring of wine on
ancient altars, as well as of instruments such as the ritual axes,
patellae,  and other instruments whose uses were described in ancient
texts by Livy, Ovid and others. Machiavelli, however, found a productive
fierceness in the religious rituals of the ancients, writing that the
ancients were more in love with freedom than the moderns are, because
their religious institutions are more powerful,  "counting first among
them the magnificence of their sacrifices as compared with ours.  There
is more delicacy than splendour in our display, and no ferocious or
jubilant action whatsoever.  There was no lack of display then, nor lack
of magnificence in their ceremonies, but added to it was the action of
the sacrifice full of blood and ferocity, where a multitude of animals
were slaughtered, which sight, being so terrible, made man behave
likewise" (<em>Discorsi sopra le Deche di Tito Livio</em> libro II, cap.
II).</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Sacrifice To Priapus</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0296"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0296-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>Priapus was a god of fertility, and also of gardens and herds.  His
cult spread from Asia Minor to Greece and Italy. In Pompeii his image
was painted on entry halls, and his statue was often placed in the
doorways of houses.  Statues of Priapus, usually represented as a
deformed man with a huge phallus, also stood as a kind of scarecrow in
gardens where he protected crops from marauding animals and other
thieves.  It was the custom to inscribe short, humorous poems to his
statue, in some of the classical verses about him he scares away thieves
by threatening to sodomize them with his miraculous member.  He was a
son of Aphrodite, but his father may be Dionysus, Adonis, Hermes or
another god.  Giulio Romano, the Roman artist who made the design for
this print, visualized the god as closely related to Dionysus.  Here,
the artist combines different ritual elements in his image of worship.
The dancing figures behind the god are Maenads, followers of
Dionysus/Bacchus who worshipped him through imbibing the wine made from
the grapes of which Dionysus was the founder.  To the left, a chubby
Silenus who has greedily filled his robe with grapes, and now has
exposed himself while trying to keep them safe, earns the evident
approval of a lusty satyr who prepares to mount him from behind.  Goats,
symbols of unbridled lust, often appear in Priapic images, as they do
here, and are also the usual ritual sacrifice to Dionysus.  The artist
shows Priapus here in the form of a herm, a pillar that usually
supported the head of Hermes with a phallus below, that guarded houses
and street-corners.. By darkening the background the artist gives the
impression that this image, like the first one in the itinerary, was
copied from an ancient frieze, which gives the scene antique authority.
It is more likely to have been the product of Giulio Romano's
well-informed ideation, an invention in which antique images of lusty
Dionysian carousing and ritual sacrifice are brought together and
enlivened through the liberal play of his own <em>fantasia</em>, or
imagination.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Scenes From The Wedding Feast Of Cupid And Psyche</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0147"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0147-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>Scenes From The Wedding Feast Of Cupid And Psyche</p>
        <p>Diana Mantovana  engraved this three-sheet print from a drawing
provided for her by another artist of a segment of Giulio Romano's
fresco of <em>The Wedding Feast of Cupid and Psyche</em>.  It illustrates
the culmination of the story <em>The Golden Ass</em> by Apuleius
(123/125-180), and was painted in the Palazzo Te in Mantua between about
1526-1528.  Diana dedicated her engraving to Claudio Gonzaga, a member
of the Mantuan ruling family who had a high position as majordomo of the
papal court in Rome, in charge of papal meals and the kitchen (the
flowery dedication appears at the bottom left corner of <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0147">A147</a>).  The
image combines elements of ancient celebration, such as the Silenus
figure in the center of the middle print, drinking from an amphora and
cuddling a small satyr, and particularly Renaissance traditions of
feasting such as the important display of the family's best dishes on a
multi-level sideboard.  Here, the tableware of the gods is imagined as
gold plate in an antique style, popularized from the many designs made
available to Renaissance artists through series of engravings of
fantastic  vases and chalices <em>all'antica</em>. Satyrs serve the gods
who have gathered on Olympus to bless the happy union of the two lovers,
who do not actually appear in Diana's print.  At the far right, Mars and
Venus are seen in a bath, attended to by a cadre of industrious angels.
Mars is being dressed by the bridegroom, Cupid, who is also Venus' son.
In the fresco, Cupid and Psyche are central to the image, reclining nude
on their marriage bed just to the right of Silenus and the table with
the display of plate, and before the table signifying the more rustic
banquet.  Diana Mantovana abbreviated her print, leaving out the scene
with the married couple which had been engraved as a separate image by
Giorgio Ghisi, perhaps feeling that the ritual sacrifice of a bride on
her marriage bed was an immodest subject for a female engraver.  With
prints such as this,  which records and interprets an image made by a
Roman artist who had moved to Mantua, and then been engraved by a
Mantuan engraver who moved to Rome a half-century later, a courtly,
Mannerist style was kept current and continually before the public eye
until the end of the sixteenth century.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>The Triumph Of Scipio</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0305"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0305-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major (ca. 236-183 BCE) became a
military hero primarily through his bloody defeat of Hannibal at
Carthage.  After the war he "sent a large part of his troops by sea
while he himself made his way through Italy.  Everywhere he found
rejoicing as much on account of the peace as for victory, when the towns
poured out to do him honour and crowds of peasants too held up his
progress along the roads.  He reached Rome and rode into the city in
triumph―triumph such as had never been seen before." (Livy, <em>The
History of Rome</em>, XXX: 45). Roman triumphs were fertile ground for
the Renaissance imagination, combining the features of a magnificent
procession with the martial glory of a marching army. The elaborately
carved Imperial triumphal arches that Renaissance Romans could still see
in the Forum carried evocative sculptures of bound captives and friezes
showing just such triumphal entries as the one pictured here (also see
prints <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0116">A116</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0136">A136</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0336">B336</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0337">B337</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0338">B338</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0339">B339</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0340">B340</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0341">B341</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0342">B342</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0343">B343</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0344">B344</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0345">B345</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0346">B346</a>,  and <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0993">D993</a>).  Triumphs included
a rigid and highly legible hierarchy of participants that built suspense
for spectators who waited for each segment of the parade to appear.
They admired the captured animals, slaves, and the spoils of the looted
country, such as the huge decorative urns, presumably heavy with
Carthaginian silver, that strong men carry aloft in this engraving.
Military trophies in the form of armor stripped from the vanquished
soldiers who follow, bound and stooped over behind the rearing horses of
the conquering Romans, are held up on spears, emphasizing the emptiness
of the protective suit and the vulnerability of the armor-less nation
(for trophies, see <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0607">C607</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0608">C608</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0609">C609</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0610">C610</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0611">C611</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0612">C612</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0613">C613</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0614">C614</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0615">C615</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0616">C616</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0617">C617</a>, and <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0618">C618</a>). Renaissance viewers
were used to participating in religious or pilgrimage processions,  to
experiencing the royal entries that dominated whole streets when
dignitaries entered the city (see #8), or to living among domestic
furniture painted with allegorical Triumphs from Petrarch's poems, the
<em>Trionfi</em>, that showed the Triumphs of Love, Death, Chastity, Fame,
Time and Eternity in colorful re-enactment of antique military triumphs.
The church adopted the form of military triumphs for Christian
ceremonies involving the translation of the relics of martyr saints, or
when Rome reincorporated into the city the bodies of important church
members, such as the heart of Carlo Borromeo, which was processed into
the city after his death.  Viewers easily enlivened their experience of
the monochromatic engravings by reading into them familiar details such
as the colorful flags, the victorious trumpeting of the trombones,  the
clamorous marching of horses and men on the stone streets, and the
shouting of spectators.  Just such details and opportunities for showing
riches and pageantry that this story provided made the Triumph of Scipio
a favorite subject for richly woven tapestries in gold, silver and
brightly colored silk threads destined for princely courts.   Giulio
Romano designed such a cycle of the Scipio story for the French king,
Francis I, now only known through copies and drawings.  Prints,
tapestries and the growing reliance of the papacy on ritual meant that
precisely choreographed and impressive ritual processions were objects
of fascination throughout the 16th century.  Print <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0307">B307</a> is a
"refreshed" version of this plate made for the publisher Philippe
Thomassin, in which the lines are regularized and enriched by Thomassin
or an engraver working for him, to compensate for the pale and worn
character of this much-printed plate.  Other scenes from the story of
Scipio are shown in prints <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0313">B313</a> and
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0306">B306</a>.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Benediction Of The Pope In St. Peter&#x27;s Square</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0170"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0170-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>For most of the 16th century new and old St. Peter's co-existed in
different proportional relationships to each other, as the old basilica
(see <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0189">B189</a>) with its
courtyard, outbuildings and sculptures came down and the new one arose
within and behind it.  The Popes continued to conduct masses there, and
to preside over public events such as the one pictured here.  In spite
of the construction, improvements were continually made to the old
complex to accommodate the performance of rituals expected by the many
pilgrims who came to Rome to receive indulgences, to pray at the site of
relics and martyrdoms, and as in this etching, to see the Pope and
receive his blessing.  At the moment the pope appears, trumpeters
arrayed on a balcony to the right announce the event, riveting the
crowd's attention on an arched opening distinguished by an honorific
canopy, located at the center of the print, on the middle story of the
Benediction Loggia.   Begun during the papacy of Pius II (1458-64), the
construction of the Benediction Loggia required stripping ancient marble
from antique buildings in nearby Ostia and Porto. It was torn down to
accommodate the façade of the new basilica at the end of the 16th
century.  The first version of this etching was made in 1567, and shows
the bell-tower behind the loggia with a pointed spire;  in 1571 that was
changed to a dome shape,  a modification that is reflected in this
version of the print, which is an almost exact copy of the 1571 version.
The print aims to show the masses of pilgrims of all classes, male and
female, flocking to the city's most important piazza to receive a ritual
benediction in the form of the sign of the cross, that will, the caption
says, protect them from the devil.  However, like the pilgrim guidebooks
to Rome that not only describe the city's religious sites and events but
also architectural monuments of any interest at all, this print offers
the most up-to-date version of papal architectural enterprises. The pope
shown here is probably meant to be Pius V (1566-1572), given the dates
of the original version, but since even under magnification no
identifying arms or other features specify a particular pope, this print
could be commercially viable at least until modifications made to the
basilica became too sweeping for the plate to accommodate the
changes.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Reception Of Cosimo I By Pope Pius V.</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0169"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0169-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>The writing on the wall in the right-hand part of this etching tells
us that "The Grand Duke of Tuscany, having come to Rome on February 18,
1570 to thank the pope for titles that had been conceded to him and to
be crowned Grand Duke, made a public entry, in which he was solemnly
accompanied by all the court between two Cardinals, and he was received
by His Holiness in public concistory in the Sala Regia, as you see in
this picture."  On August 27, 1569, in spite of opposition from the Holy
Roman Emperor,  Pope Pius V issued a papal bull granting Cosimo I de'
Medici the hereditary title of Grand Duke of Tuscany.  The formal
investment took place in Rome, and it was for this event that we see
Cosimo entering the Sala Regia, just outside the Sistine Chapel,
flanked by Cardinals and surrounded by the entire papal court.  We see
Cosimo twice, once as he enters the area where the pope is seated (we
see him from behind, on his knees, flanked by two Cardinals with others
in line behind him), and again on the stairs leading to the papal
throne.  An aide lifts the hem of the papal robe so that the pope can
extend his slipper, which Cosimo, kneeling on a step below, leans
forward to kiss.  Every moment of Cosimo's entry and his audience with
the pope was scripted to the last detail, and modeled after an ancient
rite, the ceremony of the golden rose.  Cosimo's clothing, every phrase
uttered, every gesture, when to stand up, when to walk on one's knees,
and when to read out loud his allegiance to the pope, was choreographed
with extreme care.  At the end of the ceremony Cosimo was invested with
a crown from the pope, as well as a scepter and the golden rose for which
the ceremony was named.  Ceremonies of obeisance were carefully
observed, as were all parts of royal entries, such as the one Cosimo
would have made into Rome, and from the city gates to the Vatican.   The
papal court became famous during the sixteenth century as a model for
the punctilious observance of courtly ritual.  On the wall to the left
Duperac shows the Medici coat-of-arms, now topped with the Grand-Ducal
crown that Cosimo and his descendants had just won the right to wear.
Surrounding the crown is the necklace of the order of the Golden Fleece,
which Cosimo wore at the coronation, and below it an inscription
relating to those qualities of Cosimo, mentioned in the papal bull,
which made him worthy of the title of Grand Duke, and which appear
engraved on the interior band of the crown.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica: Sistine Chapel</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0070"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0070-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>The Sistine Chapel is the setting for the sumptuous celebration of
papal mass, with a full complement of Cardinals of the church, bishops
and other members of the papal <em>curia</em>, resplendently dressed for
the occasion in their ceremonial mitres, or their red or purple hats and
cloaks (as the caption tells us).  They sit in hierachical order at
their places beyond the carved screen that separates the privileged
clergy, with direct access to mass celebrated at the altar, from the
crowd outside that is eager to see and petition the pope and cardinals.
The Cardinals seated along the wall to the pope's right are the most
important, followed by bishops, priests, deacons, and then other members
of the curial bureaucracy.  This is actually an ideal scene, for the
last part of the century was marked by complaints of disorder and
indecorous behavior at these most solemn rites.  The order of the rites
for the celebration of mass were prescribed by a congregation in charge
of ceremonies, and codified in an elaborate printed manual that was
regularly updated.  This book acted as a script for the pope and clergy
to use throughout the ritual year.  A Master of Ceremonies (n. 46) sits
on the dais closest to the pope, since he is responsible for the smooth
unfolding of the rites and maintenance of the orders of precedence that
characterize the papal court in this period.  At this moment, all is
still as the Pope and his court listen to the Sistine Chapel choir
singing from the <em>cantoria</em> (n. 51) at the lower right.  Order is
kept at the border of the inner sanctum by Swiss guards, the pope's
personal protective forces. Brambilla  takes care to differentiate
members of the exclusively male crowd outside the gate, none of whom are
identified by number, so that we can recognize tonsured monks, foppish
Frenchmen, Easterners in their Phrygian caps, local dandies, pages and
soldiers.  In the Sistine Chapel, which served both the as the pope's
private chapel and as an audience hall, tensions between the observance
of royal protocol and display of church hierarchy required a special
kind of diplomacy.  Seated almost directly across the chapel from the
pope is the secular governor of the city (n. 12), and in the middle of
the long bench on the same side are the leaders of various countries who
might be present in Rome and attending the mass that day (n. 10).
Separated in an intermediate zone between the screen and a curtain are a
group of assorted lesser noblemen (n. 20).  The elevated altar with its
<em>baldacchino</em> exactly echoes the dais containing the papal throne,
so that the body of the pope is equated with the body of Christ, in its
ritually re-enacted resurrection on the altar.  Every person and item of
ritual furniture (the altar with its book, candlesticks and crucifix
laid out, the papal throne to the left with its honorific baldacchino)
is numbered and then labeled in the key below, so that viewers of the
print can learn every arcane detail of this aspect of the papal mass.
The entire scene takes place against the backdrop of Michelangelo's
fresco of the <em>Last Judgment</em> (n. 57), the painting that completed
the pictorial program of the chapel begun during the papacy of Sixtus
IV, for whom the chapel is named.</p>

<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0067"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0067-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>In this print we see a medieval event, a jousting tournament, taking
place in a Renaissance space, the Cortile del Belvedere, during the
reign of Pius IV. The space was designed by Bramante in the reign of
Julius II to connect the Villa Belvedere, (seen at top, with fireworks),
built as a summer retreat by Innocent VIII, to the Vatican palace, then
undergoing renovation.  It was completed after Bramante's death by the
antiquarian Pirro Ligorio, during the reign of Pius IV, at just about
the time this print was made.  Even though the cortile was part of the
structure of the Vatican palace complex, it showcased many secular, and
even pagan objects and events.  The Villa housed (and still houses) the
papal collection of antique sculpture, including the famous Laocöon (<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0121">A121</a> and <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0107">A107</a>).  Many of the larger
sculptures were displayed outdoors in the formal gardens shown to the
left of the Villa structure (although in reality this area is to the
right of the Cortile, and reversed in this print).  The architecture of
the walls that make up the interior façade of the cortile is severely
and unprecedentedly classicizing, showing how deeply Bramante had
absorbed the techniques, materials and theory of ancient architecture,
and specifically of an antique hippodrome, or garden-circus, a place for
ancient games and races.  As such, a tournament is less anachronistic
than it first seems, especially since many chivalric forms were revived
in the ambience of Renaissance courts, such as the papal court.  This
spectacle with plumed riders and caparisoned horses, complete with
fireworks, took place on the penultimate day of Carnival.  It is the day
before Mardi Gras which ends the Carnival season,  when the solemn
period of Lent begins with Ash Wednesday. The joust was organized to
celebrate the wedding of the pope's nephew, Count Jacopo Annibale
Altemps, to Ortensia Borromeo. The viewing point for this print is in
the Vatican Stanze, private apartments for the Pope and his court in the
Vatican palace from which all the cortile could be seen in regular
perspective and perfectly ordered:  men and women watch from separate
bleacher-like stands in the foreground, and mounted combatants line up
to take their turn tilting at each other down clearly outlined diagonal
paths, to clash at the center.  Further from the papal window, before
the ramp leading to the upper level, things get more chaotic, as viewers
seem to be hurtling from the stands to the consternation of those
below.</p>
