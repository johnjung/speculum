<div></div><div><h2>Caraglio&#x27;s Loves of the Gods</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0630"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0630-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>This image and the next two (C631-C632) derive from the influential
<em>Loves of the Gods</em> engraved by Gian Giacopo Caraglio in Rome, ca.
1527.  They were previously owned by the painter Sir Thomas Lawrence,
and when Christie's sold his great collection (May 10, 1830) the set of
twenty was offered as by Caraglio himself; in fact the Chicago sheets
come from a French copy attributed to René Boyvin or (more likely)
Pierre Milan.  Early copies integrate the image and the verse commentary
into a single plate—the originals were printed from two plates
simultaneously, leaving a conspicuous inky joining-line—and
replicate the numbering added to the second state.  The paper is French
or Flemish, with a clear watermark (the monogram PS on a crowned
escutcheon, Briquet 9667) indicating production in Arras, 1539 or Paris,
1541.  The identical paper was used for another brilliant French copy of
an engraving by Caraglio, the <em>Adoration of the Shepherds</em> after
Parmigianino.</p>
        <p>As in the notorious <em>Modi</em> by Marcantonio Raimondi after Giulio
Romano, this series of erotic scenes sometimes displays the genitals
openly and sometimes invents postures that conceal them, as here.  The
same publisher, Baviera, seems to have commissioned both sets.  The
design of the <em>Loves of the Gods</em> was initiated by Rosso Fiorentino,
continuing his successful collaboration with
Caraglio.  After Rosso stormed off (according to Vasari) Perino del Vaga
composed <em>some</em> of the rest, though we cannot be certain which.
The default ascription to Perino should be challenged; Rossoesque
elements appear throughout, and Caraglio himself may have completed the
set using hints from both artists.</p>
        <p>Amorous encounters between gods and mortals or nymphs appear in
several of the ancient reliefs and cameos recorded in the
<em>Speculum</em>, for example 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0132">A132</a>, 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0133">A133</a>, 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0621">C621</a>, 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0624">C624</a>.  
The <em>Loves of the Gods</em> engravings emulate their flattened
frieze-like composition and play variations on their seated posture,
adding the "slung leg" gesture that came to signify sexual invitation.
Ancient sculpture also provided the attendant Cupid (e.g. 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0146">A146</a>, 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0393">B393</a>,
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0623">C623</a>, 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0742">C742</a>, 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0793">C793</a>, 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0797">C797</a>, 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0848">C848</a> ),
who here looks put-upon since he has to hold Neptune's trident as well
as his own bow.  Desire is signaled more by the electric hair than by
the facial expressions, which remain detached and statuesque.  (The
helmet of wind-swept hair became a signature of Rosso's style after he
moved to Fontainebleau, and Vasari identified the "abstracted gaze of
the figures" as one of his distinctive innovations.)  These elegant
figures seem to be rehearsing a love-scene rather than succumbing to
passion, despite the poem's allusion to the fire of love burning in the
cold ocean.  This sense of artifice is doubled by having the sea-nymph
Doris hold up the backdrop.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Bacchus</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0631"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0631-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>Many scenes from the life of Bacchus, and the orgiastic ceremonies of
his worshippers, survive from Antiquity.  The <em>Speculum</em> contains
several engravings that record Bacchic motifs (
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0091">A91</a>, 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0122">A122</a>, 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0626">C626</a>,
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0627">C627</a>, 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0664">C664</a>,
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0892">C892</a> )
or invent new ones (
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0296">B296</a>, 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0312">B312</a> ), 
some illustrating the Latin proverb "Venus grows cold without Ceres and
Bacchus" (
<a href="../serach.php?detail=speculum-0628">C628</a>,
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0629">C629</a> ).  
Caraglio depicts a relatively obscure episode, when the wine-god seduces
Erigone by first appearing as a delicious crop of grapes ("uve si
leggiadre e belle" as the poem puts it).  Erigone is caught at the
moment of transformation, gazing and pointing toward the fruit (glimpsed
at bottom left) yet starting to clamber onto the young god's thigh,
accidentally treading on his panther.</p>
        <p>The arc of windblown drapery recalls Titian's airborne racing Bacchus
in the London <em>Bacchus and Ariadne</em>, now seated but retaining his
earnest face and leggy form.  Caraglio's scrawny, vulpine male contrasts
with Erigone's voluptuous body and gemlike profile.  His immediate
predecessor is the agitated, wiry figure in Rosso's "<em>Fury</em>,"
another engraving designed for Caraglio—which has been convincingly
explained as a parody of the central figure in the <em>Laocoon</em>.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Vertumnus and Pomona</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0632"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0632-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>Vertumnus, a local god of seasonal fertility, came relatively late to
the official Roman pantheon, so this scene is number 18 in a sequence of
20.  To gain access to Pomona, goddess of the fruit harvest, he
transformed himself into an old woman—but here he appears
undisguised, with noble Jupiter-like features.  Vertumnus's foot rests
under the aroused organ of a Priapic herm, who seems alive and
interested (if slightly embarrassed), holding out the triumphal
palm-frond as if to reward the upcoming sexual victory.  A waving line
leads across the picture-frame from Vertumnus' toe to Pomona's
finely-articulated hand, each toying with its spherical fruit.  Her
right toe, meanwhile, points towards a still-life of fig-leaves and
paired apples which recreates the erogenous zones that her turning
posture places just out of sight.  These details emblematize the erotic
relation of Vertumnus and Pomona—their bodies in dance-like
proximity but touching only at the fingertips—and the artist's
toying relation to the viewer, inventing ways to sculpt the front and
back together by elegant manipulation of the serpentine figure.  A
synthesis of Raphael and Michelangelo is achieved by turning the Sistine
Chapel Eve into a figure of cool and sinuous composure.</p>
        <p>Caraglio's original engraving faithfully translates the beautiful
preparatory drawing in the British Museum, London, conventionally
attributed to Perino del Vaga though it closely resembles Rosso's
<em>disegni di stampe</em> in technique, with no trace of Perino's
nervous, brilliant hand.  Also inherited from Rosso are the ingenious
<em>contrapposto</em> and the contrast of deeply-engraved male and
cameo-like female faces.  The curved vine-arbor or berceau in the
background appears again in the decorations of Fontainebleau, so may be
another element that Rosso exported.  In our Chicago copy, dazzling but
mechanical treatment of curved cross-hatching produces a nylon-like
sheen, breaking into a moiré pattern in Pomona's right hip.  This
recalls a work almost certainly by Pierre Milan, the <em>Three Fates</em>
after Rosso.</p>
        <p>Though the three Chicago <em>Loves of the Gods</em> came from the 1830
Lawrence sale and not from an earlier <em>Speculum</em>, one tantalizing
piece of evidence suggests that the Salamanca-Lafreri business might
have acquired these French copper-plates.  One impression of this
<em>Vertumnus and Pomona</em>, in Hamburg, bears the address `Ant Sal ex'
in italics.  If this suspiciously faint signature is genuine, it means
that an independent French copying project found its way back to Italy
and thence to the wider European market.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Herms and terms</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0975"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0975-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>Herms—square pillars topped with a sculpted head and
shoulders—were another ancient feature that fascinated Renaissance
designers, and also provided a window onto sexual representation since
they normally featured an erect phallus or a socket to insert one.  They
evolved from the cults of Dionysus and Hermes and often served as
boundary markers; variants with the Roman god Terminus are therefore
called "terms."  As in <em>Vertumnus and Pomona</em> (
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0632">C632</a> ),
the herm appears in profile and defines the margin of the composition in
Michelangelo's <em>Archers</em> (
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0335">B335</a> ).  
Herms are used to brilliant effect in the first scene of the notorious
<em>Modi</em> after Giulio Romano, where they support the backdrop and
seem to gaze longingly at the embracing couple, though unlike the
version in <em>Vertumnus and Pomona</em> their sockets are empty.</p>
        <p>This pair of unusual terms is number 12 in a series engraved by Agostino
Veneziano, the crucial link between 1520s Roman print-making and the
Salamanca shop.  Agostino explored the rustic and organic origins of this
figure:  on the left, a sophisticated sculptured head and torso seems to
sprout from a palm trunk (on crocodile feet), while on the right the entire
body is formed by a draped tree stump.</p>
        <p>Agostino was probably the engraver who preserved and revived the
<em>Modi</em> designs by issuing his own copies ca. 1530.  The discovery
of a Salamanca signature on one impression of C632 (see previous) raises
an intriguing possibility:  perhaps Lafreri inherited sets of erotic
plates, available under the counter alongside the more respectable
<em>Speculum</em>?</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Bacchus meets Priapus</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0296"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0296-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p> The herm moves from the margin to the center of this endearing
<em>Sacrifice to Priapus</em>, probably designed by Giulio
Romano and certainly engraved by the Master of the Die (active ca.
1525-1560, perhaps Bernardo Dado, identified by the dice marked with a B
in the lower right corner).  This engraver, who has even been identified
as a bastard son of Marcantonio Raimondi, formed another essential link
between the Raphael workshop and the <em>Speculum</em>.  The verse
inscription is identical in form to those of the <em>Loves of the
Gods</em>, an <em>ottava rima</em> stanza that conveniently divides into
two blocks of four lines across the plinth-like base.</p>
        <p>As the poem makes clear, this frieze depicts the ceremonial
conjunction of "benign Bacchus" and Priapus, the phallic god who guarded
gardens.  The drunkenly smiling and well-endowed herm is crowned with
grape leaves.  The worshippers include Silenus, maenads and nubile
youths as well as fauns and satyrs, while their offerings include fruit
and wine-jugs as well as a goat.  The handsome, fit-looking Faunus
brings his hand close to the member of the ephebe behind him, while
making intense eye-contact with the satyress who turns toward him.
  The phrase <em>belli Modi</em> in the poem might
hint at these conjunctions.  Yet the effect is not at all pornographic:
the close, careful burin work, the shadow-line that separates the
figures from the ground, and the static, sculptural treatment of bodies
in movement, all create the look of a modern antique, a miniature
bas-relief carved in semi-precious stone.</p>
        <p>For a more detailed description see Evelyn Lincoln's Itinerary.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>A sideways glance at the Laocoon</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0121"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0121-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>This was of course the most revered of the sculptures unearthed in
the early sixteenth century, all the more so since it could be
identified with a masterpiece praised by Pliny.  Yet the exploratory wit
of contemporary artists also made parodies of this tragic composition.
In a bizarre engraving known as the "<em>Fury</em>" the team who invented
the <em>Loves of the Gods</em>—Rosso Fiorentino and Gian Giacopo Caraglio—convert Laocoon into a
   flayed-looking, maniacal figure who seems to struggle with the
serpents of his own extreme imagination.  The core elements of this
figure then reappear in <em>Bacchus and Erigone</em> (C631 in this
Itinerary):  the strained, straddled posture, knotty torso and raised
right arm, whose precise angle varied according to the different
sixteenth-century restorations.  (See Nicole Bensoussan's Itinerary.)  A
woodcut by the Venetian engraver Nicolo Boldrini, sometimes associated
with Titian, preserves the entire composition but replaces the heroic
humans with apes.</p>
        <p>The author Pietro Aretino, who played a major role in the
dissemination of erotic imagery and wrote sonnets on the <em>Modi</em>,
used the <em>Laocoon</em> as the model for a spectacular orgy
(<em>Ragionamenti</em> Day 1).  A senior prelate of the church, sandwiched
between a nun and a young male acolyte, is gripped in the convulsions of
desire just as the priest Laocoon, flanked by his two sons, is crushed
by the serpents.  At the climax his face takes on "the frowning look of
that marble figure in the Belvedere."  Aretino does not intend to
ridicule the original, which he praises in his poem <em>Marfisa</em> for
its emotional power.  Rather, the effect is to make desire
monumental.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Apollo and Daphne</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0301"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0301-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>The "Loves of the Gods" were the very first subjects of human art,
according to the poet Ovid: the tapestry-weaver Arachne, challenging the
goddess Minerva to a competition, chose exactly this theme—and for her
hubris was turned into a spider.  Caraglio's series matches the list of
amorous "crimes" that Arachne wove.  Similar cycles were invented to
decorate the walls of villas and palaces, the most influential being the
love-nest built on the Tiber by the powerful banker Agostino Chigi (now
known as the Farnesina after later owners).  Between 1511 and 1519 Chigi
commissioned amorous-themed mural paintings from Peruzzi, Sebastiano del
Piombo, Sodoma and Raphael.  The interior, which survives in excellent
condition, includes a loggia dedicated to the love-story of Cupid and
Psyche; engravings made from Raphael workshop drawings, by Marcantonio,
Agostino Veneziano, Caraglio and others, disseminated these images
widely (see <em>Speculum</em> 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0311">B311</a>, 
a detail of Juno, Ceres and Psyche).
The outside was also painted, though all but a few figures have
disappeared.  These exterior scenes probably included Mars and Venus
caught in an illicit embrace, Pasiphae seducing the bull, and four
panels narrating Apollo's frustrated love for the nymph Daphne, captured
in a set of four engravings apparently by the Master of the Die (signed
with a one-spot dice without the B).</p>
        <p>The first of these <em>Apollo and Daphne</em> plates made its way into
our <em>Speculum</em>.  We already saw how the Master of the Die combined
a classicizing composition by Giulio Romano with the eight-line verse
commentary used in <em>The Loves of the Gods</em> (<em>Sacrifice to
Priapus</em>, B296 in this Itinerary).  Here the designer is probably not
Giulio but Baldassare Peruzzi, the original architect and decorator of
the Villa Chigi-Farnesina.  In this narrative sequence, as in
allegorical plates such as 
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0300">B300</a>, 
the Master sticks closely to the vertical format of Caraglio's series.
Though Apollo appears triumphant in the foreground, slaying the monster
Python, the real story begins in the background, where he incurs the
wrath of Cupid by mocking the little boy trying to handle a grown-up
weapon.  In revenge, Cupid fires a golden arrow into Apollo's heart and
a leaden arrow into Daphne's, making her indifferent to the god's
advances.  The following scenes show the famous outcome, which also
appears as number 11 in Caraglio's <em>Loves of the Gods</em>: as Daphne
flees she turns into a laurel tree, perpetual symbol of unconsummated
desire transformed into art.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Cupid and Psyche</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0320"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0320-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>The myth of Cupid's love for the mortal Psyche, "soul" in Greek,
appeared very late in Roman literature, and so comes at the end of
Caraglio's <em>Loves of the Gods</em> (number 19, just before the closing
image of Venus and Cupid asleep).  This novel-length story of thwarted,
enduring and ultimately successful love was enshrined in the generative
space of the Villa Chigi-Farnesina, designed by Raphael and painted by a
team that included Giulio Romano (1518-19).  Within a decade, Giulio had
designed the erotic print-series <em>I Modi</em> and the resplendent
frescos of the Palazzo Te in Mantua, where the story of Cupid and Psyche
fills one of the most important rooms.  Meanwhile, an illustrated book
of 32 scenes from the Psyche cycle was engraved by the Master of the Die
and Agostino Veneziano, adapting the eight-line verse caption to a more
horizontal format than that of the <em>Loves of the Gods</em> and
<em>Apollo and Daphne</em> (C630, C631, C632, B301 in this Itinerary).
Though this ambitious series is vaguely associated with Raphael, the
exact artist is uncertain:  maybe Giulio, maybe the "Flemish Raphael"
Michiel Coxie (who designed his own <em>Loves of the Gods</em>
engravings), maybe Perino, who later reprised it in decorations for an
apartment in the Castel Sant'Angelo.</p>
        <p>The Chicago <em>Speculum</em> contains 17 sheets from a Salamanca reissue, perhaps
the one retouched by Francesco Villamena (
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0317">B317</a> -
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0333">B333</a> ).  
They show the various trials imposed on Psyche by the jealous goddess
Venus, who wants to break off her son's liaison but who eventually
blesses their marriage and Psyche's elevation to godhead.  The challenge
for the designer was how to depict Cupid, normally a mischievous winged
boy, as a youth old and real enough to marry a flesh-and-blood woman.
Here, he has simply scaled up the putto-figure, leaving him improbably
pudgy.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Cupid and Psyche:  the wedding</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0303"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0303-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>This much-used engraving by Giorgio Ghisi accurately depicts the
couple reclining on their nuptial couch, as shown in the monumental Sala
di Psiche in the Palazzo Te, Mantua.    Giulio Romano's fresco doubled the Cupid-figure, enlarging the
bridegroom into a glorious young man but nestling a smaller
<em>amorino</em> against Psyche's flank, a (protective?) arm between her
thighs.  Around them, the gods gather for the wedding banquet, while
nymphs set the table and satyrs interfere; this room is literally a
pantheon, with all the deities who elsewhere feature in their own
stories of uncontrollable appetite - Apollo, Bacchus, Silenus, Mars and
Venus, Vulcan, Pomona, and Jupiter himself, shown (with striking genital
realism) about to conceive Alexander the Great.  The entire scene,
except for the bride and groom depicted here, was refigured into an
extraordinary triple engraving by Diana Mantovana, the daughter of
Ghisi's teacher and one of the few women artists in sixteenth-century
Italy.  See Evelyn Lincoln's Itinerary for an authoritative account of
this independent <em>Feast of the Gods</em> (A147, A148, A149).</p>
