<h1>The Belvedere Cortile: An Early Museum of Ancient
Sculpture</h1>

<div></div><div><h2>Prints and the museum experience</h2></div>
<div><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0096"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0096-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>The Apollo Belvedere was a mainstay of Cardinal Giuliano delle
Rovere's sculpture collection before he became Pope Julius II, and was
one of the early statues to be placed in the Belvedere Cortile, where it
is documented from 1508. The statue court in the Belvedere Cortile was a
proto-museum that displayed some of Rome's most famous large-scale
ancient statues in a garden setting that recalled the antique
<em>viridarium</em>. Because the collection belonged to the Pope and was kept
within the Vatican complex (where most of these statues are still
displayed today), the statues were not as easily accessible to visitors
as other outdoor statues. However, Bramante's spiral staircase did
provide entry to the raised, walled space of the garden from the
outside, and numerous surviving drawings of the statues by artists prove
that the space was semi-public. Ironically, prints helped to enhance
rather than erode the aura of exclusivity and preciosity which hovered
around the Belvedere statues.</p>
          <p>In this engraving from Antonio Lafreri's <em>Speculum Romanae
Magnificentiae</em>, the Apollo statue is shown raised on a pedestal and
fitted into a niche. This niche with a simple horizontal molding is a
standard backdrop which appears on other prints of Belvedere statues
published by Lafreri, such as the Laocoon (<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0107">A107</a>) and the Hercules
Commodus (<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0094">A94</a>).
Lafreri's engravers seem to have reserved this treatment for objects in
prestigious collections, as a means of simulating the experience of
viewing from a vantage point below the statue. This staging recalls the
reverential viewing experience which our culture associates with museum
displays. Lafreri's prints remind us that such display strategies
originated in the Renaissance. The engraver's ingenuity in this regard
is evident, for the niche device is the only feature of the print which
was not appropriated from an earlier engraving by Marcantonio Raimondi
(Bartsch 331). Niches shown in Lafreri prints do not always replicate
the installation, and are often standard and conventionalized. However,
in this case, Lafreri's engraver depicts the installation with some
accuracy by including the trellis in schematic form. This trellis in the
recess behind Apollo is corroborated by other artists such as Francisco
de Hollanda.</p>
          <p>This print postdates Montorsoli's 1532-33 restorations to the statue,
which included changes to the angle of the right forearm, alterations to
the tree trunk, and the addition of new hands. Lafreri's reliance on an
earlier print by Marcantonio Raimondi is the most plausible reason
Apollo appears in unrestored form.</p>
          <p>The Latin inscription informs us of the object's nature as a marble
sculpture ("ex marmore sculp"), and its location in the pontifical
palace in the area commonly known as the Belvedere ("in palatio pont in
loco qui vulgo dicitur Belveder"). The name "Apollo" does not appear,
most likely because this statue was famous enough for immediate
recognition. The statue is believed to be a Roman copy after a lost
Hellenistic bronze.</p>
          <p>For discussion of the statue's iconography and restoration, see the
next image.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Prints as records of restorations</h2></div>
<div><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0754"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0754-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>The Apollo Belvedere was one of the most famous and best preserved
ancient statues of Renaissance Rome. This print appeared in several
editions of Giovanni Battista de' Cavalieri's <em>Antiquarum statuarum urbis
Romae</em>, which was first published in 1561. Cavalieri is an interesting
figure in the history of print publishing because he was both engraver
and publisher, and most of his plates were based on his own drawings
rather than copied from other prints.</p>
          <p>Over the centuries, the Apollo Belvedere garnered praised as a model
of ideal human proportions, masculine beauty, and poised movement. The
statue depicts Apollo, who, like his twin sister Diana, often utilized
arrows. With his right foot advanced and his right arm recoiled, he is
probably shown in the moment directly following the launching of an
arrow from the (purported) bow supported by his extended left arm. His
gaze seems to follow the arrow to its target.</p>
          <p>When excavated, Apollo Belvedere was missing only the left hand and
fingers from the right hand. The statue was displayed for over two
decades in the Belvedere statue court prior to its 1532-33 restoration
by the sculptor Giovanni Montorsoli. As recorded by drawings and prints,
Montorsoli removed the strut between the right hip and right wrist,
raised a portion of the tree trunk as structural compensation for the
lost strut, and provided a new left hand holding part of a bow.
Montorsoli's inclusion of the bow fragment was an educated guess derived
from the accessory quivers which Apollo carries. In addition, Montorsoli
mutilated part of the statue, removing the intact right forearm to
install his new right forearm and hand. This perplexing decision is
consistent with one known aspect of Renaissance antiquarianism: the
willingness to sometimes destroy or irremediably alter ancient
artifacts. In a 1924 restoration, a decision was made to reverse
Montorsoli's restorations (except for the strut). Because Montorsoli had
removed the original right forearm, the statue today appears with more
missing parts than when it was first excavated. This print accurately
documents the appearance of the statue after Montorsoli's restorations.
It also preserves the general appearance of the statue prior to the
reverse restoration of 1924.</p>
          <p>The image of Apollo with arrows and a supposed bow was an excellent
addition to the Virgilian iconographical program of Julius II's statue
court (see next image). According to the Aeneid, Apollo, in his role as
oracle, proclaimed to Aeneas that Rome would be founded by his
descendants. Also, as protector to Emperor Augustus, Apollo shot the
first arrow of the Battle of Actium in which Augustus defeated Antony
and Cleopatra. Apollo was thus a fitting emblem of the continuity Julius
II wished to establish between his own era and the Golden Age of
Imperial Rome.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>The Hercules Commodus and the Julian program for the Belvedere
Cortile</h2></div>
<div><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0094"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0094-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>In a fortuitous concordance of desires and events, Julius II expanded
his collection by acquiring exceedingly rare, freshly unearthed ancient
statues. The statue of Commodus as Hercules was excavated in 1507 from
the garden of a house in Rome's Campo dei Fiori. Julius II moved quickly
to purchase the statue, and it was no sooner given a prominent role in
the visual program of the Belvedere statue court. Recent interpretations
of Julius II's statue collection explore the iconographic significance
of the selection and installation of these objects. At the same time,
the gradual process of acquiring statues subsequent to the designing of
the statue court resulted in an ad hoc, revisable "program."</p>
          <p>Julius installed the Hercules statue near the entrance to the statue
court. Above the entrance appeared an inscription from Virgil's Aeneid:
"procul este profane" ("begone, ye uninitiated").  In the Aeneid, these
words are uttered by the Cumaen Sybil to Aeneas as he enters the
underworld. After escaping from burning Troy, Aeneas descends to the
underworld where he is greeted by his father Anchises, who prophesies
the founding of Rome by Aeneas' descendants and identifies the future
heroes of Roman history. The thematic relationship between the Hercules
statue and the entrance inscription also lies with the Aeneid: in the
Aeneid, Aeneas is described fleeing Troy in Herculean attire.</p>
          <p>Julius' 1506 acquisition of the statue of the Trojan priest Laocoon
(see <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0107">A107</a>) seems to
have provided the impetus for the statue court's Virgilian program.
Understood within the context of Julian ideology, the statue court not
only projected a sense of pride in Roman history and artifacts, but more
importantly articulated Julius' aims of "Cesaro-Papismo"―that is, the
notion of the Pope as heir to the Roman emperors and herald of a new
Golden Age. References to the Aeneid also resonated with panegyrists,
who drew connections between Julius' name and that of Aeneas' son
Ascanius, who became known as Julus after leaving Troy.</p>
          <p>In Julius' time, Tommaso Inghirami, prefect of the Vatican Library,
identified the statue as the Emperor Commodus in the guise of Hercules
on the basis of ancient texts stating that Commodus liked to appear in
the guise of Hercules. Lafreri's inscription maintains this
identification, and also mentions the small child held by Hercules, but
does not explain the child's role. As first suggested in the nineteenth
century, this statue probably depicts Hercules and not an emperor
portrait. The child could therefore be Hercules' son Telephos.</p>
          <p>This engraving bears marks of censorship, as someone has used heavy
pen lines to obliterate the genitalia of both Hercules and Telephos.  These hatched and cross-hatched lines appear to form the contours of
(additional) animal skins.</p>
          <p>In the inscription, Lafreri identifies himself as "sequani", a Latin
name for one of the Gallic tribes. This learned reference vaunts the
cosmopolitanism of our French publisher who operated in Rome.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Translating sculpture into two dimensions</h2></div>
<div><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0350"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0350-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>The Belvedere Torso was first recorded in Rome in the fifteenth
century, and most likely entered the papal collection in the 1530s
during the papacy of Clement VII. This over life-sized fragment,
believed to represent Hercules, attracted fame in the sixteenth-century
with Michelangelo's well-documented fondness for its muscular form.
Michelangelo adapted the Belvedere Torso in numerous works such as the
painted <em>ignudi</em> on the Sistine Ceiling and the sculpture of
<em>Day</em> for the tomb of Giuliano de' Medici. Michelangelo's
adaptations suggest a variety of ways in which Renaissance artists drew
upon ancient sculptural sources, including reuse in both two-dimensional
and three-dimensional media.</p>
          <p>Prints facilitated Renaissance artists' reuse of sculptural
prototypes into two dimensions by rendering volume and mass pictorially
through hatching and other graphic means. However, the translation into
two dimensions usually engendered a loss of visual information. In this
instance, the engraver Francesco Aquila anticipated the problem by
including two separate views of the torso on the same sheet. These two
views can be characterized as the informational view and the artistic
view.  The left "informational" view shows the front of the torso and
the animal pelt, transcribes the signature ("Apollonius, son of Nestor,
Athenian") by the Greek sculptor on the base. 
and registers all of the places where limbs and body parts are
truncated. The right "artistic" view captures the part of the statue
that most appealed to artists: the expressively contorted musculature of
the back. The statue's twisting pose which encourages viewing from all
sides may further explain Aquila's decision to provide two views. The
Italian inscription markets this feature of the print ("mostrato in due
vedute"), and we might entertain the idea that this was a smart purchase
for the buyer of these single-leaf prints, almost like obtaining two
prints for the price of one.</p>
          <p>In addition to its non-frontality, the Belvedere Torso differs from
other famous works of the Belvedere collection in its marked state of
fragmentation. Whereas some of the Belvedere statues had missing parts
restored in the Renaissance, the Belvedere Torso remained unchanged. It
is possible that the fragmentary and anonymous features of the torso
made it easier for artists to imagine new uses.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>The Vatican complex and the Borgo</h2></div>
<div><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0597"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0597-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>This etching is by Israel Sylvestre, an artist from Lorraine who
specialized in topographical views of France and Italy. Sylvestre
traveled to Italy three times between 1638 and 1654, recording
landscapes and architecture of Rome, Florence and Venice. These images
were then sold in France by his publisher, Israel Henriet. This etching
depicts Saint Peter's basilica and the circular structure of the Castel
Sant'Angelo on the right bank of the Tiber River.</p>
          <p>Although the Belvedere statue court is not visible, the etching does
show Bramante's three-storey loggia immediately to the right of the
basilica. The purpose of this long wing extending to the north was to
connect the Apostolic Palace to the 1487 villa of Innocent VIII located
on the northern periphery of the Vatican Hill. Another loggia structure
(constructed after Bramante's death) ran parallel to the one shown here,
and the large open space between these two wings formed a courtyard or
"cortile" that was used for tournaments and other celebrations, as seen
in <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0067">A67</a>. Bramante's
architecture solved the problem of balancing the higher terrain on which
the Villa Belvedere sat by providing a steady horizontal line in the
roof of the loggia, and by designing ramps and terraces that created
gradual transitions between the ground levels.  Built adjacent to the
Villa Belvedere, the Belvedere statue court was a courtyard within a
courtyard located at the northeast end of Bramante's cortile.</p>
          <p>Sylvestre's etching presents an idyllic scene of human activity. A
silhouetted figure at left shoots a hunting rifle aimed at ducks in the
water, two nearby figures rest on the shore, and a fishing boat lingers
in the middle of the river. A typical feature of Sylvestre's etchings,
inherited from the manner of the Lorraine artist Jacques Callot, is the
shadowy delineation of foreground areas with dense calligraphic lines to
frame the scene. The asymmetrical placement of the foreground tree
directs the eye in a rightward movement in order to appreciate the
expansive vista of the Vatican architecture as it runs parallel to the
water. These compositional choices nevertheless undermine topographical
accuracy―in reality, St. Peter's is farther back from both the river
bank and from the Castel Sant'Angelo, and there were many more buildings
(including the Egyptian obelisk) in the borgo which would have
obstructed the view of St. Peter's from across the river.</p>
          <p>In terms of architectural history and urban planning, Sylvestre's
etching dates from circa 1650, a short time before the construction of
Bernini's majestic colonnade for St. Peter's square, which began in 1656
(see <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0082">A82</a>).This print
documents another project by Bernini, the bell towers for the façade of
St. Peter's. On the south end of the façade, one of the towers appears,
its construction seemingly halted.  The towers, begun in 1638, were ordered destroyed
in 1646 by Pope Innocent X after their weight was determined to have
caused cracks in the structure. Thus, Sylvestre's view appears to show
the south tower not in construction, but rather being dismantled.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Laocoon at arm&#x27;s length</h2></div>
<div><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0121"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0121-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>Claude Duchet, known as Claudio Duchetti in Italian, was a French
publisher in Rome who inherited part of the publishing house of his
uncle, Antonio Lafreri upon his 1577 death.  Duchet continued the
enterprise of the Speculum, making copies of Lafreri plates to replace
inventory that was lost when part of the business went to another
relative, Etienne Duchet. Here, Claude Duchet's engraver copied in
precise detail a print engraved by Beatrizet and published by Lafreri.
This Beatrizet print was itself copied from an earlier print of the
Laocoon group by Marco Dente (Bartsch 353), with the only differences
being the background and Laocoon's restored right arm. The continuity
with Dente's print demonstrates how engravers sometimes used previous
engravings as pictorial templates, rather than copying directly from a
statue or monument in Rome. Another example of this practice is
Lafreri's Apollo Belvedere (<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0096">A96</a>), based on a print by
Marcantonio Raimondi. Copying an earlier print was convenient because it
provided instant solutions to issues like vantage point, presentation,
and the modeling of forms.</p>
          <p>The right arm on the central figure of Laocoon was missing when the
statue was excavated in 1506.  In the course of its complex history,
numerous solutions for the position of the arm were proposed, and some
of these were attached only to be subsequently removed and replaced by
others. Aspects of the restoration history are still debated or
uncertain. In 1532-33, Montorsoli created a terracotta addition which
restored the arm. Either Montorsoli's restoration or another
sixteenth-century arm made for the Laocoon is shown in Duchet's print.
This arm holds a diagonal, extended position. An antique arm believed to
be the original was unearthed in 1906, and was attached to the statue in
1942. This antique arm (which remains on the statue today) differs from
the Renaissance restoration in that the forearm is bent backwards rather
than outstretched.</p>
          <p>Duchet's print shows that at this time the statue was unevenly
restored, for even though Laocoon's arm is replaced, his two sons both
have missing parts, as they did upon excavation: the right arm of the
child on the left is missing, and the right fingers of the child on the
right are missing. Clearly, Renaissance restorers, like modern scholars,
first focused their attention on the arm of Laocoon, which is so crucial
to interpreting the expressive tenor of his struggle.</p>
          <p>For discussion of the discovery and iconography of this statue, see
the next image.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Laocoon continued</h2></div>
<div><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0868"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0868-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>Following in the wake of successful publications by Antonio Lafreri
and Giovanni Battista de' Cavalieri, this print comes from Lorenzo della
Vaccaria's <em>Antiquarum Statuarum Urbis Romae</em>, a compilation
depicting ancient statues in private and public Roman collections.
Vaccaria employed Cherubino Alberti, Orazio de Santis and several other
artists as engravers. This print is related to a plate in Cavalieri's
publication, except that the Laocoon statue is here shown in reverse
with a different background. The stage of restoration shown in this
print approximates a c. 1591 drawing by Hendrick Goltzius, which depicts
Laocoon with a restored arm, the youngest son with a restored arm, and
the eldest son with three missing fingers. This print and the Goltzius
drawing are records of a second restoration that restored the son's arm
sometime after the first restoration of Laocoon's arm (this first
restoration is documented in <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0121">A121</a>).</p>
          <p>The 1506 unearthing of the Laocoon was a momentous event enshrined in
collective memory. It was discovered on January 14 in the vineyard of
Felice de'Freddi on the Esquiline hill. Michelangelo and Giuliano da
Sangallo came to inspect the statue, and Sangallo was said to have
immediately recognized the group as the work described by Pliny.
According to Pliny, it was sculpted by Hagesandrus, Polidorus, and
Athenodorus of Rhodes, was carved from a single piece of marble, and was
"of all paintings and sculptures, the most worthy of admiration."
Sixteenth-century antiquarians, upon realizing that it was made of
several marble blocks, began to question whether it could be the same
statue Pliny described. The statue Pliny revered was already likely a
marble copy after a bronze original, and thus continual questions about
the dating and authorship of this statue have not eclipsed its
reputation.</p>
          <p>According to the story of Laocoon's death in Virgil's Aeneid, Laocoon
was a Trojan priest who rightfully suspected the wooden horse offered by
the Greeks, warning the Trojans not to bring it into the city. He
pierced the horse with his spear to see if Greeks were inside, saying "I
fear the Greeks, even when they bring gifts." Athena, who sided with the
Greeks, sent two serpents to kill Laocoon and his sons in order to
prevent him from stopping the Greek treachery. The statue depicts
Laocoon and one of his sons being overtaken by the snakes, while the
older son begins to break free. This moving representation of a
struggling man as he succumbs to death has elicited much discussion and
praise as a consummate work of art, particularly among
eighteenth-century German scholars.</p>
          <p>Julius II purchased the statue within a month of its discovery, and
the Laocoon group established the Virgilian program for his statue
court. As noted by Hans Brummer, within the Romanocentric ideology of
Julius II, the story of Laocoon was understood as a portent for the Fall
of Troy, which eventually led to the founding of Rome.</p>
          <p>The inscription calls attention to the connection between the statue
and the writings of Virgil and Pliny, which contributed to the statue's
fame. The wall shown behind the statue is an imagined setting, for the
statue was actually installed in an architectural niche.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Installation and Interpretation</h2></div>
<div><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0867"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0867-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>This image depicts the Vatican Cleopatra, a second-century Roman copy
of a Greek original of the Hellenistic period. The print is from Lorenzo
della Vaccaria's <em>Antiquarum Statuarum Urbis Romae</em>, which first
appeared in 1584. Dating each individual print is a complicated matter,
because many plates were reused across different editions. This print
comes from the edition issued in 1621, when numbering was introduced
(see the number 47 in the lower left). Vaccaria's publication takes its
title, conception, and many of its printed images from Giovanni Battista
de' Cavalieri's publication. In this instance, Vaccaria's engraver has
wholeheartedly copied the entire image from Cavalieri. The main
differences are the number and the background composed of fine
horizontal striations. This kind of copying was common in the
unregulated publishing industry of Renaissance Rome.</p>
          <p>About a decade after its excavation, Julius II purchased the
Cleopatra statue in 1512 from Gerolamo Maffei, a member of a prominent
Roman family of collectors. The statue was installed in the Belvedere
Cortile within a shallow niche and equipped with a fountain mechanism.
The fountain installation was a humanist conceit related to contemporary
antiquarian interest in water nymphs. Even though the statue was
identified as the dying Egyptian queen Cleopatra because of the snake
bracelet around her arm (Cleopatra committed suicide by poisoning
herself with an asp), the nymph association was also central to
Renaissance interpretations. Indeed, the print's inscription
acknowledges both identifications. In the eighteenth-century, it was
found that the statue depicts neither Cleopatra nor a nymph, but rather
Ariadne lying on the shores of Naxos after her abandonment by
Theseus.</p>
          <p>This print records a later installation of the statue which retained
certain elements, such as the fountain, from Julius' II installation. In
1551 during the papacy of Julius III, the statue was transferred from
its niche in the statue court to the indoor "Stanza della Cleopatra," a
small room at the northern extremity of the eastern corridor which
opened onto the statue court. The walls and ceiling of the room were
richly decorated with stucco, ornamental grotesque imagery, and frescoes
by Daniele da Volterra of Old Testament subjects connected with water.
As shown here, the statue was set into an architectural fountain
framework consisting of a large scallop shell on the ground level and
two terms supporting an upper mantelpiece decorated with a winged mask.
The statue crowned this superstructure, and the grotto-like middle area
between the herms appears to be where the fountain water flowed. This
construction mirrored contemporary developments in landscape
architecture, and reinforced the statue's nymph iconography by evoking
nymphs' traditional dwelling place, the grotto.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>The Tiber River God</h2></div>
<div><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0108"><img src="http://speculum.lib.uchicago.edu/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0108-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>This print depicts the nude statue of the River God Tiber holding a
cornucopia and a broken udder (restored in the eighteenth century),
resting atop a base that was carved with ridges to represent water. The
statue was unearthed in January 1512 near Santa Maria Sopra Minerva.
Like several other recent discoveries, it was quickly acquired by Julius
II and integrated into the Belvedere Cortile setting. Arriving soon
after the Cleopatra statue, it too was eventually equipped with a
fountain to highlight the aquatic theme.</p>
          <p>This print was engraved by Nicolas Béatrizet for Lafreri's <em>Speculum
Romanae Magnificentiae</em>. The fictive frieze shown along three borders of
the image shows the human activity such as commerce, transport, fishing
and swimming which occurred in the river. It also depicts the types of
fauna which could be observed along the banks of Rome's river, including
sheep, foxes, and horses. The frieze is a clever way of showing the
scenes that are carved in relief on the sides and back of the statue
base, which would not be visible in this view. There were several
well-known antique statues in Rome with similar pose and appearance. The
elegantly tapered inscription in Roman capitals provides information
that was possibly intended to help the viewer differentiate this statue,
both visually and thematically, from the other statues of river gods.
For example, the inscription mentions the presence of Romulus and Remus,
the twin brothers who founded Rome, along with the she-wolf that
nurtured them with breast milk. These figures appear beneath the
cornucopia held by the river god. Beyond the information it offers, the
inscription serves to guarantee quality and accuracy: in the last
sentence, the viewer is assured that Lafreri printed this image in
copper with precision ("ad amussim excusum").</p>
          <p>In terms of graphic effect, this print is indeed executed with
remarkable precision and skill. The frieze and inscription enliven the
white area behind the horizontal statue. Also, there is a careful visual
alternation of gray and crisp white tones, particularly in the small
negative spaces around the god's limbs. </p>
          <p>Unlike its pendant the Nile (see next image), the Tiber is one of the
few statues that left the Belvedere collection permanently. It was
removed by Napoleon in 1797, and is now displayed in the Louvre.</p>

In 1513, the year after the discovery of the Tiber statue, the Nile was
unearthed at the same site, and was purchased by Leo X, the successor to
Julius II. These companion statues were mounted on identical large
plinths and were displayed facing each other in the middle of the
Belvedere statue court. This arrangement made sense, because the head of
the Nile statue is oriented to the right, whereas the Tiber is oriented
to the left, and the two statues would have been nicely aligned when
placed facing each other. The two statues are also very close in scale:
both are colossal statues over three meters long.</p>
          <p>It is fitting that Béatrizet employed the same formula for his prints
of the Tiber (see previous image) and the Nile, because even in
antiquity they were treated as pendants, as indicated by the close
proximity of their burial sites. Thus, we see in this print the same
approach employed in the Tiber print: a border frieze derived from the
actual reliefs on the sides and back of the statue base, and an
extensive inscription in Roman capitals with tapered formatting.</p>
          <p>The Nile-specific iconography includes the local attribute of the
sphinx beneath the deity's arm, and the exotic animals such as
crocodiles and hippos in the border frieze. The putti climbing on and
around the god's body also relate to the locale: Pliny described a
famous statue with sixteen figures of children, which represented the
sixteen cubits the Nile needed to rise during the rainy season in order
to irrigate the land. The Nile statue is probably a Roman copy of the
Alexandrian statue described by Pliny.</p>
          <p>Some of the putti shown here are missing heads or other body parts.
This reflects the statue as it appeared in the Renaissance. The putti
were not restored until the eighteenth century under Pope Clement
XIV.</p>
