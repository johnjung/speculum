<h1>Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo: A Military Itinerary Through Rome and the
Speculum</h1>
<p class="author">Martha Pollak<br/><em>Professor of Art History, University of Illinois at Chicago</em></p>
<div id="itinerary_grid">
<div></div><div><h2>Map of Rome</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0002"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0002-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome was probably the most visible and
frequented of European fortresses.[1] Guarding the only wholly-surviving
ancient Roman bridge, which connected the papal compound of the Vatican
to Rome itself, the citadel confronted every single pilgrim who visited
the city and who wanted to worship at the presumed site of Peter's tomb.
Coming from Rome, the pious tourist would pass through the gateway
formed by the statues of Peter and Paul, but this welcoming duo were
followed by the looming and glowering round tower that formed the
Vatican side of the bridge, where the visitor would pass through the
military checkpoint and take a sharp left turn towards Saint Peter's (
<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0026">A26</a> ).  Further
linked by a separate wall to the papal palace, Castel Sant'Angelo served
as a place of last resort.  When Pope Clement VII took refuge there in
1527 during the siege of Rome the entire Christian world, Catholic and
Protestant, became acquainted with the appearance of this military
structure through the published broadsheets that reported on the
conflict.  Its massive cylindrical form, incorporating the tomb of the
emperor Hadrian, came to symbolize Rome itself in countless paintings
and engravings.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Castle of Sant&#x27;Angelo (1559 - 1565)</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0026"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0026-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>The medieval citadel, partly strengthened during the fifteenth century,
was to have been thoroughly modernized by Antonio da Sangallo the
Younger, the architect of the Florentine citadel, commissioned by Pope
Paul III Farnese.  The fortification experience of Antonio's older
relatives evidently guided him: extant drawings by Giuliano and Antonio
da Sangallo the Elder come close to the condition of the Castel
Sant'Angelo.  The younger Antonio's project (1542-46) was to transform
the late fifteenth-century bastions that had been built by Pope
Alexander VI Borgia in the attempt to protect Rome from the French
invasion of 1494.  It was intended to double the fortification belt
around the core of the citadel composed of Hadrian's tomb, and to
rectify the road passing from the bridge to Saint Peter's, removing
existing obstacles and achieving as much symmetry as the site
allowed.</p>

<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0430"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0430-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>The complexity of the situation on the ground can be read from Antonio's
drawings.  As Nicholas Adams shows, he proposes several solutions with
little relation between them―triangular, rectangular, rhomboidal,
hexagonal as well as pentagonal fortresses.[2]  The ambivalent relation of
the fortress to Rome, even more complex than that of the equivalent
Florentine citadel, made resolution difficult: the citadel was a daily
reminder for the local population of the tense and often fraught
relations between the papal government and the oligarchic city council.
None of Antonio's projects was realized, but they clarified one part of
the citadel's identity: he would have enlarged the medieval castle about
four times, introducing a city-sized building as a hinge between Rome
and the Vatican suburb.  Evidently, the papal initiatives to fortify
Rome were torn between direct concern with the Vatican and a citadel
which would have symbolized too clearly the need for protection―not
only from outside the city but also from the two distinct parts of
Rome.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Castle Of Sant&#x27;Angelo (1575 - 1586)</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0182"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0182-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>It is on this important foundation of graphic studies and strategic
discussions for the citadel by Antonio da Sangallo that the actual
pentagonal reconfiguration of Castel Sant'Angelo was carried out by the
military architect Francesco Laparelli between 1561 and 1565.[3]  This
architect gained great renown for his fortification of Valletta on the
island of Malta, but in Rome he was part of the last important
sixteenth-century wave of Florentine influence.  The fortress of Rome
thus benefited from the earlier Medici sponsorship of the citadel in
Florence.  By the time it was built, however, the Castel Sant'Angelo had
a stronger competitor for attention in the citadel of Turin, which was
built simultaneously, and completed earlier.  Of the three the citadel
of Rome had the most distinguished life in print, reaching a wide
audience of religious tourists, as well as military officials.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Castle Of Sant&#x27;Angelo (1581 - 1586)</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0040"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0040-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>The newly fortified citadel became an important subject for the
illustrations of Rome, in plans and views, which were produced for
pilgrims' purchases.  The citadel thus has a significant life in visual
culture, where it is often illustrated out of scale, even larger than
its actual size, dominating the vulnerable bridge―the connecting link
between Rome and the Vatican.  In sixteenth-century views of Rome, the
fortress looms large; matching the scale of Saint Peter's and the
Vatican palaces, it dominates the urban topography.  Foregrounded by its
proximity to the spiritual center of the city, it is the only secular
structure illustrated in the widely disseminated view by Lafréri.
Beside the illustrations of Saint Peter's, the citadel of
Rome is the only building in the city, ancient or modern, to receive
extensive attention in printed illustrations.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Castle Of Sant&#x27;Angelo (1590 - 1591)</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0046"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0046-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>The Castel Sant'Angelo combined the functions of multiple urban
buildings, and displayed multiple layers of Roman history.  Its
cylindrical core resembled the tomb of the Metella (<a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0049">A49</a>, <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0432">C432</a> ) and that
of Augustus ( <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0282">B282</a> ); but in
ancient Rome, the castrum of the Praetorian guard ( <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0030">A30</a> ) served as
the de facto fortress of the city.  In the Renaissance it functioned as
a palace with important decorated state and private rooms, but also as a
defense installation, serving as vault, crowd-control obstacle, and
customs' house.  As a papal site it was dedicated to the archangel
Michael, just as its individual bastions were dedicated to saints and
architects.  Beyond the published images, which clarified these
functions abroad, the guides to Rome enumerated the treasures guarded
within its confines.  As late as the eighteenth century the citadel was
portrayed, by Giovanni Battista Piranesi for example, with its abundant
ammunition proudly displayed in its court.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Views Of Rome And Of Other Cities And Places (1600)</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0545"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0545-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>The new pentagonal fortress distanced "modern" geometrical design
from the time-honored permutations of the square and the circle
inherited from antiquity and Middle Ages.  In the Castel Sant'Angelo the
new citadel literally incorporates and goes beyond the cylindrical
mausoleum and the medieval four-sided, turreted enceinte; its appearance
is a cross-section of its troubled history ( <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0430">C430</a> ).  The
rhetorical function of its graphic representation underlines the great
size of the installation; the exaggerated dimensions are meant to
illustrate a lack of continuity between the fortress and the surrounding
buildings of the Vatican suburb.  The old round tower within the new
polygonal bastions became an emblem of military-architectural prowess,
displayed on foundation medals and recreated in mock-sieges and
fireworks that celebrated victories. In <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0182">B182</a> the
towering dominance of the superstructure is underlined by the Vatican
loggie that are allowed to loom in the distance.  The configuration of
Castel Sant'Angelo―a more-or-less regular bastioned polygon with
its fifth side completed by a waterfront―was imitated elsewhere.
Examples include the Tower of London (again embracing a formidable older
castle), and the fortification of ports such as Pesaro on the Adriatic,
or Candia in Crete.[4]  Thus the eventual design of Castel Sant'Angelo
recapitulates the history of "ancient" and "modern" geometry.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Views Of Rome (1610)</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0188"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0188-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>The papal functions of Castel Sant'Angelo included service in times
of peace and celebration.  Biringuccio, the earliest writer to write
about fireworks (in his military treatise), describes the most famous
design of this exhilarating form of early modern entertainment, the
Girandola.  Turning the fortress into a beacon of fire ( <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0040">A40</a> ) watched
by great crowds from the safety of the other shore, it was used to
celebrate papal coronations (with the earliest fireworks ignited in
1481), and subsequently associated with the Castel Sant'Angelo, which
acted as the fireworks' machine.[5]  Thus one of the most significant
urban fortresses―and one of the most visible experiments with the
pentagonal citadel―was also the most prominent pyrotechnic site.
The Girandola, equally celebrated as the Roman candle, shot upward in a
long trail of light, exploding into a bright ball in the air and then
fizzling slowly downward like a gentle rain of fire.  Spinning, shooting
upward, and showering down, these set pieces of fireworks design
incorporated contrasting directions, speed, and light quality, implying
the ambivalence of this visual artefact.  Together with the Catherine
wheel and the rocket, this design has survived in the contemporary
vocabulary of fireworks display―a continued reminder that, through
the adoption of artillery for war and peace activities, defense,
destruction and illumination come to be linked in the popular urban
imagination. In <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0545">C545</a> the halo
of smoke from the fireworks turns the fortress in to a "glory" that
resembles the religious imagery of counter-Reformation art.</p>
      
</div><div></div><div><h2>Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo (Hadrian&#x27;s Mausoleum) (1621)</h2></div>
<div class="thumb_grid"><a href="/search.php?detail=speculum-0283"><img src="/images/searchthumbs/speculum-0283-001t.jpg"/></a></div><div><p>As the site of a repeated ludic event, Castel Sant'Angelo is the
modern equivalent of other military entertainments, revivals from
antiquity or strenuously cultivated medieval inheritances.  A military
itinerary of the Speculum would include the joust in the Belvedere court
( <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0067">A67</a> )―between
the Vatican palace and the papal Villa Belvedere―which turns this
magisterial architectural site into an amphitheatre for highly
choreographed military conflict.  This balletic entertainment takes
place in the enclosure framed by Bramante's corridors, and is
accompanied by fireworks joyously exploding from the heights of the
Belvedere villa.  The view documents an important moment in the history
of this "architectural" garden, whose axial and tiered composition would
be disrupted by the insertion of the Vatican library during the reign of
pope Sixtus V.  The theatrically framed and large outdoor space, echoing
the ancient Roman circus known to have been on this site, would have
further reminded the educated audience of Claudio Duchetti's
illustration of the "naumachia," the naval battle ( <a href="../search.php?detail=speculum-0044">A44</a> ), which
reconstructed an ambitious form of another ancient Roman entertainment.
In its specially built amphitheatre, the flooded arena held a multitude
of boats, festively rigged-out and gamely educating a large public in
the rudiments of military engagement at sea.</p>
        <p>Strong house, entertainment center, and monumental historic building,
Castel Sant'Angelo's ample presence in the graphic record clarifies its
centrality in the imagination of Rome's inhabitants and tourists.</p>
